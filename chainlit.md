# PairReader - Chat with Your Documents 📚

PairReader lets you upload your documents and ask questions about them. It's like having a study partner who never forgets anything!

## 🎯 How to Use

**Three usage modes:**

**📖 Chat** - Ask questions about documents you've already uploaded (just start typing!)
**✏️ Update** - Add new documents to your existing collection
**🆕 Create** - Start fresh with a new knowledge base

To **Update** or **Create**, click the buttons at startup or use commands: **/Update**, **/Create**

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **First time?** Click **Create** to upload your documents
2. **Upload files** (supports PDF and text files, up to 5 files at a time)
3. **Ask questions** - PairReader intelligently routes your query:
   - **Most questions** (default) → QA Agent provides targeted answers
   - **Explicit exploration** (e.g., "Give me an overview" or "What are the main themes?") → Discovery Agent provides comprehensive exploration

## 💡 Tips

- **Upload related documents** to connect ideas across them
- **Ask natural questions** - the QA agent handles most requests automatically
- **For exploration, be explicit** - say "overview", "main themes", "key ideas", or "explore the documents"
- **Review subqueries** when prompted - it helps you see how your question is being analyzed
- **Use "Create"** to start fresh when switching to a completely different topic
- **Start with exploration** on new documents to understand what's available

## 🎨 Customize Your Experience

**Happy reading!** 📖✨
